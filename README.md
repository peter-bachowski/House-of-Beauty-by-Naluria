# House-of-Beauty-by-Naluria

This website is dedicated to my fiancee Naluria and is to be designed as a business website for her hair, makeup and eyelash services. 

This website will be using all the html and css tools that I have learned so far, and will be implementing some javascript along the way. 

This will be my largest project so far and will take a substantial amount of time to complete and will be updating regulary until completion. 

To anyone who has taken the time to read the README.md file I thank you for your support.
